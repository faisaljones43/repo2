How to Run the App
Save the files: Create the files app.py, database.py, billing.py, and requirements.txt in a folder as described.
Install dependencies: Open your terminal, navigate to that folder, and run:
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
Run the Streamlit app: In the same terminal, run:
Generated bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Your web browser should open with the application running.
How to Use the App
Seed Data: The app will automatically create three sample users (Jim, Pam, Dwight) the first time you run it.
User Dashboard:
Select a user from the dropdown.
Click the "Scan to Check-In" button multiple times to simulate them visiting the gym on different days. You can run the app for several days to create a history.
View their check-in history and any generated invoices.
Admin Panel:
Add a new user using the form.
Run Billing: Click the "Run Monthly Billing Process" button. This will:
Look at the previous full calendar month.
Check each user's activity during that month.
Apply the 20% penalty if they had a gap of 4 or more consecutive days without a check-in.
Create an invoice record in the database.
Display a summary of the invoices it just created.
This prototype provides a solid foundation. For a real-world application, you would expand on this by integrating a real payment gateway (like Stripe), adding user authentication, and deploying it to a cloud server with a real cron job for the billing process.
